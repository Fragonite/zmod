# zmod
Basic modding framework for DW8XLCE.  
Includes support for the following:

- High resolutions
- Ultrawide aspect ratios
- 120 FPS
- Improved frame timing
- Custom camera distance, height, and angle
- English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese language support

It is recommended to set the FPS limit in Nvidia Control Panel to your target FPS. This will make the gameplay much smoother, even at 60 Hz.

To install, download the latest release from https://github.com/Fragonite/zmod/releases/latest and extract the contents to your game directory. Run zmod.exe to start the game (Steam should be running first).
